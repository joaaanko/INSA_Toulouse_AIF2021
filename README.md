# DEFI IA 2022

This code repository servs a collabotary for the DÃ©fi IA 2022. 

Here is the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/defi-ia-2022/overview) of the competition, where the [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/defi-ia-2022/leaderboard) and [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/defi-ia-2022/data) are available.

Participants (INSA Toulouse): 
- Juan Antonio AYALA BANDA
- Jeong Hwan KO
- Aldo MELLADO AGUILAR
- Alice LALOUE
- Nicolas PREVOT

## Goal of the project

 The goal is to predict the accumulated daily rainfall on ground stations, where the ground stations are the measuring stations at a ground-level altitude. The satations available are scattered around north-western France. 
 
 ## Scoring methodology
 
 The scoring metric used in this project is the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE):
 - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=MAPE = \frac{100}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \abs\frac{A_t - F_t}{A_t})">

 
 The lower the score, the better.
